# Operating-Systems-Hardening

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **Operating System (OS) Hardening**, a security process designed to minimize vulnerabilities by implementing security measures such as **firewalls, access controls, patch management, and system monitoring**. Our team researched and implemented OS hardening best practices to enhance system security.

## Project Contents
The project covers key security steps, including:

### 1️⃣ System Configuration
- Disable unnecessary services to reduce security risks.
- Set up firewalls to control network access.
- Enforce strong password policies.

### 2️⃣ User & Access Control
- Create user accounts with **limited access**.
- Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for extra security.
- Remove inactive accounts to prevent unauthorized access.

### 3️⃣ Patch & Update Management
- Install security patches to fix vulnerabilities.
- Enable **automatic updates** to stay protected.
- Remove outdated or unsupported software.

### 4️⃣ Network Security
- Use **firewalls & Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** to monitor traffic.
- Disable **unused network services** to reduce attack vectors.
- Enable **VPN encryption** for secure remote access.

### 5️⃣ Logging & Monitoring
- Enable system logs to track activities.
- Use log analysis tools to detect potential threats.
- Set up alerts for **suspicious activity**.

### 6️⃣ Application Security & Backup
- Allow only **approved applications** to run.
- Regularly update software to close security gaps.
- Create **secure backups** to prevent data loss.

## Step-by-Step Hardening Guide
1. **Configure System Settings**
   - Disable unused services.
   - Set up **firewalls** and enforce strong passwords.
2. **Manage User Access**
   - Enable **MFA** and remove unused accounts.
3. **Apply Updates & Patches**
   - Keep OS and software up to date.
4. **Secure Network**
   - Configure **firewalls** and restrict unused ports.
   - Use **VPN encryption** for remote access.
5. **Enable Logging & Monitoring**
   - Track system logs and set up **security alerts**.
6. **Secure Applications & Data**
   - Whitelist applications and create backups.

## My Role: **Presenter**
As the **presenter**, I was responsible for:
- **Delivering the final presentation** of our research findings.
- **Explaining OS hardening techniques** and their importance.
- **Summarizing key security measures** for system protection.
- **Engaging with the audience** by addressing questions.

## Findings & Observations
- **No outdated software** was found on the system.
- **Unnecessary services were disabled**, reducing the attack surface.
- **Security logs were monitored**, with no suspicious activity detected.

## Future Enhancements
- Automating OS hardening tasks with security scripts.
- Implementing **AI-driven log analysis** for threat detection.
- Exploring **zero-trust security models** for stronger protection.
